    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working on a kaggle competition. You may not want the full nbdev.  For example, you don't need separate documentation from your notebooks and you're never going to release it to pip or conda.  This module simplifies the process so you just run one command and it creates .py files from your notebooks.  Maybe you are doing an ensemble and to export the dataloaders from a notebook so you can import them into seperate notebooks for your seperate models, or maybe you have a seperate use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what this module does.  it's just the #export flags from nbdev and exporting to a module folder with no setup (ie settings.ini, \\_\\_nbdev.py, etc.) for fast minimal use"
